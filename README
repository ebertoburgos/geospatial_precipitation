PySpark and Jupyter Notebook Docker Setup
This README provides instructions on how to set up and run a PySpark script using Docker, and how to use Jupyter Notebook to execute queries. This setup is configured using the jupyter/pyspark-notebook Docker image and a custom Dockerfile.

Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from Docker's official website.

Docker Image: We will use the jupyter/pyspark-notebook Docker image, and we will also create a custom Dockerfile to set up the environment.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone or Download the Project
Clone or download the project directory that contains your PySpark script and any other necessary files.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
2. Create and Update the Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in your project directory with the following content:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use the jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base image
FROM jupyter/pyspark-notebook:latest

# Create the output directory and set permissions
RUN mkdir -p /home/jovyan/work/data && \
    chmod -R 777 /home/jovyan/work/data

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /home/jovyan/work

# Copy your PySpark script and other files to the Docker image
COPY pyspark_script.py /home/jovyan/work/pyspark_script.py
COPY requirements.txt /home/jovyan/work/requirements.txt

# Install additional Python packages if needed
RUN pip install -r /home/jovyan/work/requirements.txt

# Expose port for Jupyter Notebook
EXPOSE 8888

# By default, the container will start the Jupyter Notebook server
CMD ["start-notebook.sh", "--NotebookApp.token=''"]
3. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t custom-pyspark-jupyter .
4. Run the Docker Container
Run the Docker container with volume mounting to sync your local project directory with the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work custom-pyspark-jupyter
-p 8888:8888: Maps port 8888 of the container to port 8888 on your host machine.
-v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work: Mounts the current directory to /home/jovyan/work inside the container.
5. Access Jupyter Notebook
Open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8888
You should see the Jupyter Notebook interface. No token is required due to the --NotebookApp.token='' configuration in the Dockerfile.

6. Run the PySpark Script
Open a Terminal in Jupyter Notebook:

From the Jupyter Notebook interface, open a new terminal from the New menu.
Run the PySpark Script:

In the terminal, execute the PySpark script using spark-submit:

bash
Copy code
spark-submit /home/jovyan/work/pyspark_script.py
7. Execute Queries in Jupyter Notebook
Create a New Notebook:

From the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on New and select Python 3 to create a new notebook.
Run PySpark Code:

In the new notebook, you can write and execute PySpark code to interact with data. For example, you can read data, run SQL queries, and perform transformations.
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("MySparkApp") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read data
df = spark.read.csv("/home/jovyan/work/data/mydata.csv")
df.show()

# Run SQL queries
df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE some_column > 10")
result.show()
Troubleshooting
Permission Issues: If you encounter permission issues, ensure that the directory /home/jovyan/work/data inside the container is writable. The Dockerfile sets 777 permissions for development purposes.
Port Conflicts: Ensure that port 8888 is not being used by another application on your host machine.
